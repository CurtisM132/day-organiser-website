### Software
* Snowpack
** Snowpack is a modern, lightweight build tool for faster web development. Traditional JavaScript build tools like webpack and Parcel need to rebuild & rebundle entire chunks of your application every time you save a single file. Snowpack serves your application unbundled during development. Each file needs to be built only once and then is cached forever. When a file changes, Snowpack rebuilds that single file. Thereâ€™s no time wasted re-bundling every change, just instant updates in the browser.
** Snowpack gets you the best of both worlds: fast, unbundled development with optimized performance in your bundled production builds.
